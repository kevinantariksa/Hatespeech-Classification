# Hatespeech-Classification
My project is about detecting hatespeech on '2019gantipresiden' hashtag.
That mean, dataset is in Bahasa.
I provide you another dataset, but its not my main dataset. Feel free to ask my main dataset via email: kevinantariksa@outlook.co.id

How to use:
1. I recommend you use jupyter notebook or that kind
2. Use 'Ambil Dataset Twitter.ipynb' for getting tweet data
3. Run the 'SkripsiFinalKevin' for getting my classification results

Classification:
- Feature extraction: Using TFIDF, N-gram (2,3 words level and 2,3 char level), and Word2Vec
- Algorithm: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM
